The docker-compose available in debian bullseye is currently version 1.25, which is too low for the cgroup rules.
install 1.27 via: sudo apt install docker-compose/bullseye-backports
or run install script update-docker-cli.sh in this repo.

init is required when using gr_satellites etc, otherwise ends up with defunct processes.

named volume for persitant varstate data between compose down/up instead of creating new ones every time.
