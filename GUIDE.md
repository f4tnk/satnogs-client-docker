# Guide for dockerized satnogs-client

## Intro
This is aimed for those who want to try out the client in docker and thinks it's a bit too complicated.<br>
I will try to explain the basic concepts and how to get up and running.<br>
My preferred distro is Debian 11 (bullseye) and this guide will be tailored for it, but there should only be small differences to others.<br>
You do not need to clone this repo to run the image.

## Basic parts of docker, [Official overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)
***Images*** are usually hosted on a registry, for example hub.docker.com, from where you can pull them to your system.
They are the complete software bundled to run an application, in this case a debian image and a lot of packages installed that is required for satnogs-client.<br>
***Container*** is the running instance of an image and is basically an isolated environment where you run the app.
They are always start fresh from the image and can be modified, but it's non-persistent so after a stop any changes are lost.<br>
***Volumes*** is either a persistent storage for containers or bind-mounted to your host for configuration or storage.

# Getting satnogs-client up and running
## Host system
You will need to install the libraries and supporting sw/fw for your sdr device, including udev rules and blacklists.<br>
Additional software such as soapysdr is not needed on the host, but can certainly be installed or if you already have a working ansible install etc.<br>
`sudo apt install rtl-sdr`

See the [docker installation](#install-dockerio) at the bottom of this page.

## Scripts
I recommend creating a few scripts that can be run to make the management easier.

client-up.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
docker run \
    --name satnogs-client \
    --device=/dev/bus/usb/ \
    --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v ~/satnogs-config:/.env \
    -d knegge/satnogs-client:latest
```

client-down.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
docker stop satnogs-client
docker container rm satnogs-client
```

client-update.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
docker pull knegge/satnogs-client:latest
./client-down.sh
./client-up.sh
```

Make the script executable: `chmod 0755 client-up.sh client-down.sh client-update.sh`

## Client config
If you already have a working config for the station, I recommend copying it. You can also change the scripts to use the system location of the config.<br>
Choose one of the following:
Copy the config to the home directory `cp /etc/default/satnogs-client ~/satnogs-config`<br>
OR<br>
Change the config line in client-up.sh to `-v /etc/default/satnogs-client:/.env \`<br>
Docker will try to create a directory named after the bind-mount if the file doesn't exist, in this case you need to remove the directory.

Template for ~/satnogs-config , edit for your id/token etc.
```
SATNOGS_API_TOKEN=""
SATNOGS_STATION_ID=""
SATNOGS_STATION_LAT=""
SATNOGS_STATION_LON=""
SATNOGS_STATION_ELEV=""
SATNOGS_SOAPY_RX_DEVICE="driver=rtlsdr"
SATNOGS_RX_SAMP_RATE="1.024e6"
SATNOGS_PPM_ERROR="0"
SATNOGS_RF_GAIN="20.7"
SATNOGS_ANTENNA="RX"
SATNOGS_LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

## Explanation of the scrips

These are made for a single client, but can easily be modified for running several different clients on one host.<br>
The actual client is started as detached, so you will not see it's output when launched.<br>
First start the container with `./client-up.sh`, first time it will pull and extract the image.<br>
To see what it's doing you can run the log viewer `docker logs satnogs-client -f -t -n 50`, it will show the last 50 rows, timestamped, and follow.
Starting and stopping a container can be done with `docker start satnogs-client` and `docker stop satnogs-client`.<br>

The client-up.sh script details:<br>
`docker run` is the command to create an instance of an image.<br>
`--name satnogs-client` giving it a name.<br>
`--device=/dev/bus/usb/` mapping usb devices into the container, required for rtl-sdr but not plutosdr.<br>
`--tmpfs /tmp` creating a tmpfs of /tmp as satnogs-client stores it's running data here.<br>
`-v ~/satnogs-config:/.env` bind-mounting the configuration file to .env inside the container, which is read by the client.<br>
`-d knegge/satnogs-client:latest` this specifies the image to use, and detach mode. You can replace `-d` with `-it` to run it in foreground.<br>

## Inside the container
When the container starts, it executes [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) which contains:
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
rigctld -T 127.0.0.1 -m 1 &
source bin/activate
exec "$@"
```

This starts `rigctld` which is used for the doppler coreection.<br>
Then activates the `virtualenv` located in the satnogs user homedir. It contains all the python requirements.<br>
Last it executes the argument given, in this case `satnogs-client`.<br>
If you're using portainer you can look in the container list if it is running, or use `docker ps -a`.


## [Tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/knegge/satnogs-client/tags)
You may have noticed the `:latest` when referring to the image, this is a tag that points to the latest image.<br>
There can be several images with tags differentiating them, as well as imgages having several tags.<br>
Today there's at least one additional image developed, it contains a set of popular addons and uses the `:latest` image plus a bunch of compiled software.<br>
If you want to use this, replace the `:latest` with `:addons` in the scripts. It will pull this image automatically, and you can swap between them at any time.<br>
Stopping a container does not change the tag, you need to remove and recreate it as is done with the -up and -down scripts.<br>


## Addons
[gr-satellites](https://github.com/daniestevez/gr-satellites) is a popular demod and decoder and there's an integration into satnogs-client, this has been added to the :addons image and to activate it you will need to add a few rows to the config:
```
SATNOGS_PRE_OBSERVATION_SCRIPT="satnogs-pre {{ID}} {{FREQ}} {{TLE}} {{TIMESTAMP}} {{BAUD}} {{SCRIPT_NAME}}"
SATNOGS_POST_OBSERVATION_SCRIPT="satnogs-post {{ID}} {{FREQ}} {{TLE}} {{TIMESTAMP}} {{BAUD}} {{SCRIPT_NAME}}"
UDP_DUMP_HOST="0.0.0.0"
```
And change the tag in the client-up.sh to: `-d knegge/satnogs-client:addons`.<br>
Then run `./client-down.sh && ./client-up.sh` 

The pre-/-post observation script launches [grsat-wrapper.sh](https://github.com/kng/satnogs_gr-satellites/blob/main/grsat-wrapper.sh) and this is the glue between gr-satellites and satnogs-client.<br>
Make sure to remove or comment out these 3 lines if you're running the :latest tag instead of :addons.<br>

## Test SDR
The :addons also has a useful script to test your sdr and config, to launch it you can use this script (remember to set the config path):
```
#!/bin/bash
docker run \
    --device=/dev/bus/usb/ \
    --tmpfs /tmp \
    -v ~/satnogs-config:/.env \
    --rm -it knegge/satnogs-client:addons test-flowgraph.sh
```
Let it run for ~30s and then exit with Ctrl-C.


## Auto scheduler
A nice way to increase the utilization of your station is to run the [satnogs-auto-scheduler](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-auto-scheduler).<br>
For this I use pretty much the same scripts as mentioned above.<br>

scheduler-up.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
# remember to create cache volume
if ! docker volume inspect satnogs-auto-scheduler-cache > /dev/null 2>&1 ; then
        echo "creating cache volume"
        docker volume create satnogs-auto-scheduler-cache
        docker run --rm -u 0:0 -v satnogs-auto-scheduler-cache:/tmp/cache/ -it knegge/satnogs-auto-scheduler:latest chown -R satnogs:satnogs /tmp/cache/
fi

docker run \
    --name satnogs-auto-scheduler \
    -v satnogs-auto-scheduler-cache:/tmp/cache/ \
    -v ~/satnogs-config:/.env \
    -d knegge/satnogs-auto-scheduler:latest
```

scheduler-down.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
docker stop satnogs-auto-scheduler
docker container rm satnogs-auto-scheduler
#docker volume rm satnogs-auto-scheduler-cache
```

scheduler-update.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
docker pull knegge/satnogs-auto-scheduler:latest
./scheduler-down.sh
./scheduler-up.sh
```

Additionally ,you will need to add this to the `~/satnogs-config`:
```
SATNOGS_SCHEDULE_EXTRA="-d 1.2"
SATNOGS_DB_API_TOKEN=""
```

The EXTRA parameter is the command line that is [passed](https://github.com/kng/satnogs-auto-scheduler-docker/blob/master/entrypoint.sh#L21) to [schedule_single_station.py](https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/satnogs-auto-scheduler/-/blob/master/schedule_single_station.py), except the station ID.<br>
DB key is recommended as it speeds up the TLE pull. It can be obtained from [DB](https://db.satnogs.org/) and select settings/api token in the upper right.<br>
Start it up with `./scheduler-up.sh` and watch the log with `docker logs satnogs-auto-scheduler -n 50 -f -t`.



# Install Docker.io

In Debian bullseye there's already a docker package, so installation is easy:
```
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo adduser pi docker
```

Re-login for the group premission to take effect.

## Recommended install: [Portainer](https://docs.portainer.io/start/install/server/docker/linux)

```
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```
Then browse to https://yourDocker:9443 and follow the instruction, use local socket in the "Get started" section.


# For reference: Install Docker Engine (docker.com)

Refer to [docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) on how to get the latest installed on your system.<br>
Short version, ymmv: Base image: Rasperry Pi OS 64bit or 32bit Lite (bullseye):
```
# already installed: ca-certificates curl lsb-release
# optional: tmux uidmap
